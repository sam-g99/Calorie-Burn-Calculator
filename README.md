# Calorie-Burn-Calculator
https://vigorous-archimedes-8dbac2.netlify.com/

This program estimates how many calories a person would burn based on their weight
and activies. The activities currently supported are walking, running, and jumping jacks.
This program also has the ability to generate routines based on user preferences, such as a how many
calories a user would like to burn and which activity they would like to do the most.

This was an old project of mine that helped me get started with front-end web developer basics. I decided to bring this project back to see what the community can bring through [DigitialOcean's Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com).
